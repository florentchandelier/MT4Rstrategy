# Risk(s) and Warning(s)
Please carefully review information highlighting some of the most significant risks that Forex transactions may pose for individual investors, from United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) 
[“COMMISSION ADVISORY BEWARE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING FRAUDS”](http://www.cftc.gov/opa/enf98/opaforexa15.htm), 
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [“INVESTOR BULLETING: FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE (FOREX) TRADING FOR INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS“](http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-150.htm) and the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) [“INVESTING IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE (FOREX)”](http://www.esma.europa.eu/news/Investing-foreign-exchange-forex?t=326&o=home)

Trading foreign exchange and futures on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade in 
foreign exchange, futures or other products, you should carefully consider, **with support from competent counsel in the matter of money management as legally defined in its jurisdiction**, 
your financial objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. 

The risks described herein are not purported to be exhaustive. **Investment products and strategies are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal amount invested and therefore you should not invest money 
that you cannot afford to loose.** 

All performance claims on this web site about trading system performance must be regarded as hypothetical. There is often a vast difference between hypothetical results and real-life trading results achievable in an a 
real brokerage account, and real-life results are almost always vastly worse than hypothetical results. Simulated or hypothetical trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. 
No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to these being shown.

Past performance is not indicative of future results.

[ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE V1.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) as stated in [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/florentchandelier/MT4Rstrategy/blob/master/License.txt) 
with its supplement file [SUPPFILE.txt](https://github.com/florentchandelier/MT4Rstrategy/blob/master/suppfile.txt).

*Why APL V1.0?* Beside the fact that the initial contributor may make personal choices affecting part of the license terms, **section *3.6* grants independent modules with separate license agreements**. 

Optimistically speaking, this may provide an excellent dynamic for public/private contributions, providing that modularity has been accounted for appropriately (refer to *section 1.7* of APL V1.0) during code design and development.

## CODE LAYOUT and DIRECTORIES

I will use primarily [R](http://www.r-project.org) for implementation as I believe this is a straight-forward yet extremely powerful framework in forms of scripting language for statistics. Along with the code, there should be different **.Rproj**
 files corresponding to **project workspaces** for the excellent [R-Studio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com). **Codes and Scripts validation and Verification was carried on under R-version:3.0.0 (2013.04.03) and RStudio-version:0.97.551.**
