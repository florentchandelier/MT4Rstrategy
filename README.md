# OBJECTIVES
The objective behind this repo is to leverage the statistical framework of [R](http://www.r-project.org) to design trading strategies, and further use these to trade the [$200Billion](http://www.forexbrokerz.com/news/april-retail-forex-volume-record) 
of retail [Forex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market) volume through the 
[Metatrader4 platform](http://www.metatrader4.com/). **The goal** is to empower **retail Forex traders** having limited trading funds, with relevant open source solutions addressing the different processes required to the making of
a trading strategy, but at a fragment of the cost associated to state-of-the-art trading platforms.

## LICENSE
[ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE V1.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) as stated in [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/florentchandelier/MT4Rstrategy/blob/master/License.txt) 
with its supplement file [SUPPFILE.txt](https://github.com/florentchandelier/MT4Rstrategy/blob/master/suppfile.txt).

*Why APL V1.0?* Beside the fact that the initial contributor may make personal choices affecting part of the license terms, **section *3.6* grants independent modules with separate license agreements**. 

Optimistically speaking, this may provide an excellent dynamic for public/private contributions, providing that modularity has been accounted for appropriately (refer to *section 1.7* of APL V1.0) during code design and development.

## CODE LAYOUT and DIRECTORIES

I will use primarily [R](http://www.r-project.org) for implementation as I believe this is a straight-forward yet extremely powerful framework in forms of scripting language for statistics. Along with the code, there should be different **.Rproj**
 files corresponding to **project workspaces** for the excellent [R-Studio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com). **Codes and Scripts validation and Verification was carried on under R-version:3.0.0 (2013.04.03) and RStudio-version:0.97.551.**
